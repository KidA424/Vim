"# vimfiles"

This repository contains my entire vim filetree, which holds many custom-built vimscript files as well as borrowed and/or modified plugins. I do not use a plugin manager. This ultimately allows me to retain control over my Vim experience while preventing my system from growing so large that settings and resources begin to conflict with each other. When you don't manually manage your filetree, it's easy to lose track of which files live where, and even forget that certain files exist altogether.

If you are interested in learning vim, there is no better place to start than the tutorial "Learn Vimscript The Hard Way" (http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
