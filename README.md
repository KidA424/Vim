# vim

This repository contains my vim filetree, which holds custom vimscript files as well as borrowed and/or modified plugins.  This does not use a plugin manager.  If you are interested in learning Vim, checkout the tutorial "Learn Vimscript The Hard Way" (http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
